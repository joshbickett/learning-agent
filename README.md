# Self Learning Agent

## Overview

The `Self Learning Agent` is a project that pushes the boundaries of automated learning. It showcases the capability of a model to adapt, finetune, and interpret new information using web data.

## Features

- **Colab Integration**: The agent can be seamlessly loaded into a Google Colab notebook, enabling users to interact and test its capabilities with ease.

- **Data Acquisition with Open Interpreter**: Utilizing the Open Interpreter, the agent is able to gather and process web data, ensuring a vast and diversified dataset for its learning endeavors.

- **Self Fine-tuning**: One of the project's hallmarks is its ability to introspectively refine its performance. It doesn't just use the data; it evolves with it.

- **Interpretation Post Fine-tuning**: After the fine-tuning process, the agent employs the Open Interpreter again but this time
